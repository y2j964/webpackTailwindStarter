## General Info
This is a simple frontend boilerplate with webpack support. You might use this if you wanted to a quick mockup that was a little more complex than your standard CodePen/CodeSandbox affair. However, you probably wouldn't build a site around this. For such things, use a dedicated framework (React, Vue, Svelt), or a SSG (Hugo, Gatsby).

## Features
* Webpack 5
* PostCSS
* TailwindCSS
* JS module bundling
* Static image minifying

Simply clone this repo, and run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
